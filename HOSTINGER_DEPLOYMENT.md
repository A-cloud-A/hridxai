# Hostinger Deployment Guide for HridxAI React App

## 🚀 Hostinger PHP Hosting Setup

This guide will help you deploy your React application to Hostinger's PHP hosting service.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Hostinger hosting account
- File manager access or FTP client
- Node.js installed locally (for building)

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Build Your React App Locally

```bash
# Run the Hostinger-specific build command
npm run build:hostinger
```

This will:
- ✅ Run TypeScript type checking
- ✅ Run ESLint
- ✅ Build the production version
- ✅ Create the `dist` folder with all assets

### 2. Prepare Files for Upload

After building, you need to upload these files to Hostinger:

**Required Files:**
- `composer.json` ✅ (Created)
- `index.php` ✅ (Created) 
- `.htaccess` ✅ (Created)
- `dist/` folder ✅ (Generated by build)

**Optional Files:**
- `README.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`

### 3. Upload to Hostinger

#### Option A: Using Hostinger File Manager
1. Log into your Hostinger control panel
2. Go to **File Manager**
3. Navigate to your domain's `public_html` folder
4. Upload all the required files

#### Option B: Using FTP Client
1. Connect to your Hostinger FTP
2. Navigate to `public_html` folder
3. Upload all files maintaining the folder structure

### 4. File Structure on Hostinger

Your Hostinger `public_html` should look like this:
```
public_html/
├── composer.json
├── index.php
├── .htaccess
├── dist/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── assets/
│       ├── index-[hash].js
│       └── index-[hash].css
└── README.md (optional)
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Hostinger detects `composer.json`** ✅
2. **Apache serves `index.php`** as the main entry point
3. **`index.php` loads the React app** from the `dist` folder
4. **`.htaccess` handles SPA routing** and static file serving
5. **Static assets are served directly** from the `dist` folder

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Build Required" Error
**Solution:** Make sure you've run `npm run build` and uploaded the `dist` folder.

### Issue: 404 Errors on Page Refresh
**Solution:** Check that `.htaccess` file is uploaded correctly.

### Issue: Static Assets Not Loading
**Solution:** Verify the `dist/assets/` folder is uploaded with all files.

### Issue: Composer Not Detected
**Solution:** Ensure `composer.json` is in the root directory of `public_html`.

## 🔄 Updating Your App

To update your deployed app:

1. Make changes to your React code
2. Run `npm run build:hostinger`
3. Upload the new `dist` folder contents
4. Your app will be updated!

## 📝 Notes

- **No Node.js required** on Hostinger (PHP hosting)
- **Static files served efficiently** with caching headers
- **SPA routing works** with proper `.htaccess` configuration
- **Security headers included** for better protection
- **Compression enabled** for faster loading

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Build your app: `npm run build:hostinger`
2. Upload files to Hostinger
3. Visit your domain to see your React app live!
